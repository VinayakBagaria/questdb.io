AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog with software listings from independent
software vendors that runs on AWS. This guide describes how to launch QuestDB
via the AWS Marketplace using the official listing. This document also describes
usage instructions after you have launched the instance, including hints for
authentication, the available interfaces, and tips for accessing the REST API
and web console.

## Prerequisites

- An [Amazon Web Services](https://console.aws.amazon.com) account

## Launching QuestDB on the AWS Marketplace

The QuestDB listing can be found in the AWS Marketplace under the databases
category. To launch a QuestDB instance:

1. Navigate to the
   [QuestDB listing](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?searchTerms=questdb)
2. Click **Continue to Subscribe** and subscribe to the offering
3. **Configure** a version, an AWS region and click **Continue to** **Launch**
4. Choose an instance type and network configuration and click **Launch**

An information panel displays the ID of the QuestDB instance with launch
configuration details and hints for locating the instance in the EC2 console.

## QuestDB configuration

The server configuration file is at the following location on the AMI:

```bash
/var/lib/questdb/conf/server.conf
```

For details on the server properties and using this file, see the
[server configuration documentation](/docs/reference/configuration).

The default ports used by QuestDB interfaces are as follows:

- Web console &amp; REST API is available on port `9000`
- PostgreSQL wire protocol available on `8812`
- InfluxDB line protocol `9009` (TCP and UDP)
- Health monitoring &amp; Prometheus `/metrics` `9003`

### Postgres credentials

Generated credentials can found in the server configuration file:

```bash
/var/lib/questdb/conf/server.conf
```

The default Postgres username is `admin` and a password is randomly generated
during startup:

```ini
pg.user=admin
pg.password=...
```

### InfluxDB line protocol credentials

The credentials for InfluxDB line protocol can be found at

```bash
/var/lib/questdb/conf/full_auth.json
```

For details on authentication using this protocol, see the
[InfluxDB line protocol authentication guide](/docs/reference/api/ilp/authenticate).

### Disabling authentication

If you would like to disable authentication for Postgres wire protocol or
InfluxDB line protocol, comment out the following lines in the server
configuration file:

```ini title="/var/lib/questdb/conf/server.conf"
# pg.password=...

# line.tcp.auth.db.path=conf/auth.txt
```

### Disabling interfaces

Interfaces may be **disabled completely** with the following configuration:

```ini title="/var/lib/questdb/conf/server.conf"
# disable postgres
pg.enabled=false

# disable InfluxDB line protocol over TCP and UDP
line.tcp.enabled=false
line.udp.enabled=false

# disable HTTP (web console and REST API)
http.enabled=false
```

The HTTP interface may alternatively be set to **readonly**:

```ini title="/var/lib/questdb/conf/server.conf"
# set HTTP interface to readonly
http.security.readonly=true
```

## Upgrading QuestDB

:::note

- Check the [release notes](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases) and
  ensure that necessary [backup](/docs/operations/backup/) is completed.

:::

You can perform the following steps to upgrade your QuestDB version on an official AWS QuestDB AMI:

- Stop the service:

```shell
systemctl stop questdb.service
```

- Download and copy over the new binary

<InterpolateReleaseData
  renderText={(release) => (
    <CodeBlock className="language-shell">
      {`wget https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases/download/${release.name}/questdb-${release.name}-no-jre-bin.tar.gz \\
tar xzvf questdb-${release.name}-no-jre-bin.tar.gz
cp questdb-${release.name}-no-jre-bin/questdb.jar /usr/local/bin/questdb.jar
cp questdb-${release.name}-no-jre-bin/questdb.jar /usr/local/bin/questdb-${release.name}.jar`}
    </CodeBlock>
  )}
/>

- Restart the service again:

```shell
systemctl restart questdb.service
systemctl status questdb.service
```
